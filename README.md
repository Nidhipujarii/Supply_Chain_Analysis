# Supply Chain Analysis

## **Comapny's background**
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodara. They want to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.

## **Problem Statement**
+ AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. 
+ It is speculated that customer retention issues due to possible delays or incomplete deliveries of essential products, impacting the overall customer service.
+ Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities. 
+ So they have tasked the supply chain analytics team with tracking the **'On-time delivery (OT) %'**,**'In-full delivery (IF) %'**,' and **'OnTime in full (OTIF) %'** for all customer orders on a daily basis. 

## Let's understand the key metrics before diving deep:                                                                

### ***On Time delivery % (OT%)***                                                                                    
+ It determines if an order is delivered as per the agreed time with the customer. 

### Formula: 
+ Number of orders delivered On Time / Total Number of Orders                                   

###  ***In Full delivery % (IF%)***                                                                                                
+ It determines if an order is delivered in full as per the requested quantity by the customer.   

### Formula: 
+ Number of orders delivered in Full quantity / Total Number of Orders        
                                                                                   
### ***On Time In Full (OTIF) %***                                                                           
+ It determines if an order is delivered BOTH in full and On Time as per the customer order request.

### Formula: 
+ Number of orders delivered both IN Full & On Time / Total Number of Orders

### ***Line Fill Rate (LIFR%)***                                                                                          
+ IT is an important metric to understand how many lines they shipped out of the total lines ordered. 

### Formula: 
+ Number of order lines shipped In Full Quantity / Total Order Lines

### ***Volume Fill Rate (VOFR%)***                                                                                         
+ It is understand the total quantity they are able to ship for a customer per order or for a given period of time

### Formula: 
+ Total Quantity shipped / Total Quantity Ordered

### ***Orders and Lines***
+ Orders are nothing but a unique request placed by a customer on a given date
+ Within an order, a customer could request multiple items. Each of these items requested within the order is called an order line
